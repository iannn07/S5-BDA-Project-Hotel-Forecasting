# Forecasting the Return on Investment (ROI) for a House in Melbourne: A Five-year Sales Analysis

This project is used for forecasting the ROI of new home clusters that will be constructed in the next year in Melbourne by taking past data such as reviews, prices, etc.

The details of this project could be accessed through this document:

## Dataset

[Melbourne Housing Market](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market?select=Melbourne_housing_FULL.csv)

## Project Structure

This project is will implementing Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP - DM), which includes:

1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

However, we wil separate it into several phases as follows:

- [Data Preprocessing](https://github.com/iannn07/S5-BDA-Project-House-ROI-Forecasting/blob/main/1.%20Data%20Pre-Processing/Data%20Preprocessing.ipynb)
- [Checking the OLS Assumptions](https://github.com/iannn07/S5-BDA-Project-House-ROI-Forecasting/blob/main/2.%20OLS%20Assumptions/OLS%20Assumptions.ipynb)
- [Dummy Variables](https://github.com/iannn07/S5-BDA-Project-House-ROI-Forecasting/blob/main/3.%20Dummy%20Variables/Dummy%20Variables.ipynb)
- [Modeling](https://github.com/iannn07/S5-BDA-Project-House-ROI-Forecasting/blob/main/4.%20Modeling/Modeling.ipynb)

### Data Preprocessing

1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Reduction

### Modeling

1. [Multi Linear Regression](https://github.com/iannn07/S5-BDA-Project-House-ROI-Forecasting/tree/main/Multiple%20Linear%20Regression)
2. Logistic Regression

## Summary

We could say that the data is not well-suited for regression analysis, and this issue indicates that the data is not linear. You could see the result of this dataset analysis in [here](https://github.com/iannn07/S5-BDA-Project-House-ROI-Forecasting/blob/main/4.%20Modeling/Modeling.ipynb).
